But, behold, why do ye ponder these things in your hearts?</p></li>
                    <li id="2 ne_32.2" class = "verse"><p class = "m-0 px-1 py-1">2 Do ye not remember that I said unto you that after ye had received the Holy Ghost ye could speak with the tongue of angels? And now, how could ye speak with the tongue of angels save it were by the Holy Ghost?</p></li>

Wherefore, I said unto you, feast upon the words of Christ; for behold, the words of Christ will tell you all things what ye should do.</p></li>

And when he shall manifest himself unto you in the flesh, the things which he shall say unto you shall ye observe to do.</p></li>

                    <li id="2 ne_32.8" class = "verse"><p class = "m-0 px-1 py-1">8 And now, my beloved brethren, I perceive that ye ponder still in your hearts; and it grieveth me that I must speak concerning this thing.  For if ye would hearken unto the Spirit which teacheth a man to pray, ye would know that ye must pray; for the evil spirit teacheth not a man to pray, but teacheth him that he must not pray.</p></li>
                    <li id="2 ne_32.9" class = "verse"><p class = "m-0 px-1 py-1">9 But behold, I say unto you that ye must pray always, and not faint; that ye must not perform any thing unto the Lord save in the first place ye shall pray unto the Father in the name of Christ, that he will consecrate thy performance unto thee, that thy performance may be for the welfare of thy soul.</p></li>
